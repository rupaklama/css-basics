    <h1>Text Semantics</h1>

    <!-- note: use CSS for styling. These tags are use for Semantic Elements now. -->

    <!-- <em> element is for text that have a stressed emphasis to focus compared to surrounding text 
    By default, the visual result is the same. However, the semantic meaning is different. The <em> element represents stress emphasis of its contents, while the <i> element represents text that is set off from the normal prose
    -->
    <p>I <em>really</em> need to go to bed</p>

    <!-- Modern <i> HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others but not just to italic text only -->
    <p>The <i>Yaks</i> are from the Himalayas!</p>

    <!-- <strong> HTML element indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type. -->
    <p>Whatever you do, <strong>do not let the cats out</strong></p>

    <!-- <b> HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance.  -->
    <p>This is an <b>html</b> course </p>
